===============================================================

Version: 1.0
Date: 09 December 2025
Author / Engineer: Zac Crockett
System: GRACE-X AI™ Modular Ecosystem
Jurisdiction: United Kingdom (primary), with international IP intent.

---------------------------------------------------------------
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------

GRACE-X AI™ is a modular, multi-app artificial intelligence ecosystem
designed and engineered by Zac Crockett. It combines:

• A central “Core” assistant and UI shell
• A suite of specialist modules (“apps” / “DLCs”)
• A shared audio / voice engine
• Future AR / camera and OSINT tooling

The goal is to create a real, usable AI companion that:

• Helps with real-world tasks (trades, fitness, finance, safety)
• Supports mental health and wellbeing
• Assists creators and influencers
• Helps families and kids learn and stay safe

The platform is engineered as a local HTML/JS prototype that can be
ported to web, mobile, and desktop apps.

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. CORE ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 GRACE-X Core™

The “Core” is the main brain and front-end shell.

Responsibilities:
• Boot screen, brand intro, and transitions.
• Sidebar navigation to all modules.
• Basic conversation logic and routing.
• Debug panels (last heard, last reply, last intent).
• Integration point for the AudioManager (voices) and other tools.

Key elements:
• index.html – entry point and Core shell.
• core.js – Core logic, debug tools, and shell initialisation.
• audioManager.js – shared voice/audio engine.
• core.css – base styling, layout, colours, gradients, and typography.

Trade mark:
• GRACE-X Core™ – central operating layer of the GRACE-X AI™ system.

• GRACE-X ChefPro™ – extended recipes, influencer collabs (“fakeaway”).
• GraceX StreetSafe – expansion of Guardian for maps and alerts.

All future names and ideas described here are to be treated as

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. BUILD / VERSIONING & “GODFILE” CONCEPT
---------------------------------------------------------------

The GRACE-X development workflow uses “hero builds” and “godfiles”:

• Hero build – a dated zip of the full platform that is known to run.
• Godfile – the CURRENT, CLEAN, BEST-KNOWN working build, frozen and
  never edited directly. All new work is done on a copy.

General rules:
1. Only one godfile at a time.
2. Every new dev session starts from the latest godfile copy.
3. After changes, a new hero build is saved with date + notes.
4. Once stable, that hero becomes the next godfile.

Example naming:
• HERO_09.12.25_HEADERS_V2_CORE_FIXED_FULL.zip
• GODFILE_09.12.25_GRACEX_CORE_FULL.zip (once promoted)

7. SAFETY, ETHICS & LIMITATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------

• OSINT and security tools are strictly for ethical, defensive use.
• Uplift and Family modules must not represent themselves as emergency
  services. In crisis, users should be signposted to appropriate
  helplines or services (e.g. Samaritans in the UK).
• Data collection and AR/camera features must be compliant with local
  data and privacy laws before public release.
• GRACE-X is in prototype / pre-release, with no guarantees made for
  production reliability at this stage.
