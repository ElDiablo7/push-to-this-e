GRACE-X AI™ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (MASTER)

1. WORK IN gracex_dev/ FOLDER ONLY
   - This is your active development version.
   - Do not edit inside releases/ or backups/.

2. BEFORE EVERY CHANGE (BACKUP FIRST)
   - Go to backups/
   - Create a zip: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_description.zip
   - Example: 2025-11-15_1530_pre-builder-ui.zip

3. MAKE ONE CHANGE AT A TIME
   - Edit modules/<module>.html
   - Edit assets/js/*.js
   - Edit index.html
   - Use consistent paths: assets/img/*, assets/audio/*

4. TEST LOCALLY USING PYTHON SERVER
   - Open terminal inside gracex_dev/
   - Run: python -m http.server 8000
   - Open in Firefox: http://localhost:8000/index.html

5. SMOKE TEST (EVERY TIME)
   - Boot loads
   - No console errors
   - Sidebar buttons switch modules
   - OSINT locked
   - Images load
   - Audio loads

6. FIX ANY ERRORS → RE-TEST → CONFIRM
   - Make sure everything works twice in a row.

7. DOCUMENT THE CHANGE
   - Update CHANGELOG.md (short, factual)

8. CREATE POST-FIX BACKUP
   - Save a new zip to backups/

9. OPTIONAL: CREATE DEV/PROD RELEASE
   - Dev release: full readable version
   - Prod release: cleaned/minified version

10. RECOVERY
   - If anything breaks: unzip the last backup and replace gracex_dev/

END.
